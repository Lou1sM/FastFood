# FastFood
masters thesis

Given an input dish--only a limited number of which are currently recognized--the program will return a recipe for the dish and an indication as to which steps should be performed simultaneously

TODO:
  add modularity, currently system is entirely contained in a single script
  increase list of recognized foods, or design learning component to read such foods from dictionary data
  transfer graph computations to a C implementation, for performance
